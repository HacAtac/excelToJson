## Tests

    As of now, I don't have any unit testing set up. However to get this application and have it working, just copy and paste your excel file into the root directory of this application, and make sure to name it Data.xlsx unless you rename it something else inside of the logic in index.js. Once that is done, all that is required is for you to run `npm start` or `node index.js` and it will create the JSON object inside of file in the data directory. Enjoy~
